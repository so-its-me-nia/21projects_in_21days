# 21projects_in_21days
This repo is part of the 21 Projects, 21 Days: ML, Deep Learning & GenAI challenge hosted by GeeksforGeeks Live. For me, this is both a refresher on key ML, Deep Learning, and GenAI concepts and a personal challenge to see if I can keep up the pace of building one project per day.

Each project is a hands-on exercise—sometimes revisiting fundamentals, sometimes experimenting with small new ideas.

It’s a way to brush up on skills, stay consistent, and push myself to learn actively. Every project is a small victory in my quest for AI mastery!
Feel free to explore, learn, or get inspired!
